Bowling Challenge
=================

*The logic for the bowling challenge now completed. The Scorecard can account for strikes, spares, bonus rolls, and edge cases such as gutter and perfect games. However, the game currently relies on the honour system to prevent the user inputting fake scores, as it does not limit the input options for spares to the number of pins that would in reality be available, so the user could feasibly score a frame (7-7).

If I had more time, I would like to implement a feature where the buttons displayed reflected the true scoring potential of the roll, e.g. if a user rolled a four on the first go, the buttons for 7,8,9, and 10 would disappear. I would also like to improve the aesthetic of the app as it currently resembles a row of unused bathroom tiles leaning against a wall.
